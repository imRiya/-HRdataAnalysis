Employee Performance and Satisfaction Prediction  
The dataset consists of various employee attributes such as demographics, employment status, performance scores, salary, and engagement levels. The goal of the project is to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA)


Features of the Project:
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and analysis of employee attributes to uncover insights about performance, salary distribution, engagement, and more.
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering (e.g., calculating age and tenure), and scaling numerical features.
3.Predictive Modeling: Developing machine learning models to predict employee satisfaction levels based on various features.


Tools and Technologies Used:
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
Pandas: For handling the dataset, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing (train-test split, scaling, encoding, etc.)
StandardScaler: For feature scaling of numerical variables.
Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the process interactively.
